Project Title: Innovating Advanced Methods in Fighting Financial Crime and Credit Risk / Fraud

Problem Statement:
Virtual banks, operating exclusively online, are inherently exposed to higher risks such as cyber threats and data breaches compared to traditional banks with physical branches. Emerging advanced techniques, particularly those leveraging AI and machine learning, have enabled sophisticated fraud methods, posing significant challenges for virtual banks in keeping pace with new threats. Techniques like Stable Diffusion Model generated images are being misused to create convincing deepfake identities and deceive biometric authentication systems, adding another layer of complexity to the risk landscape. 
Traditional risk detection approaches, including predictions based solely on a single fixed machine learning model, are insufficient to address these evolving risks. Therefore, there is a critical need for a revolution in risk management strategies, involving the development and implementation of complex models that integrate and analyze multiple data types utilizing innovative AI tools. These models will provide a comprehensive view of potential risks and enable proactive measures to mitigate them effectively, ensuring the security and stability of virtual banking operations.
